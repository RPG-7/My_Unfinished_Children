# My_Unfinished_Children

Some unfinished projects i've made 

Now progress:

AwV3SDevBrd:Tried to verify the design, but fail downloading program into it. JTAG ID found and it is correct, but connect via JLINK failed due to unknown reasons

CME_M5 DevBrd:

Verify board made, download ok, FPGA chip OK, SDRAM haven't tried, downloader can't use(unable to download firmware into it)

other works are all WIP,but I don't have time to verify them now.
